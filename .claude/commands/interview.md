# Interview Command

Asks interview questions and complete the specification from the `path`

## Instructions

Read the specifications. And interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: UI and UX concerns, trade-offs, etc. But make sure the questions are not obvious. Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete, then write the spec to the file. 

## Parameters
- `path` : path to the specification to be taken as initial input
